"Switch Test" by Christian Schulz

Include Switch Control by Christian Schulz.

The Terrifying Basement is a room.

The red switch is a switched on device in the Terrifying Basement. It is fixed in place.
The blue switch is a switched off device in the Terrifying Basement. It is fixed in place.

The basement light is an effect. It is everywhere.
Instead of turning off the basement light with something: now the Terrifying Basement is dark.
Instead of turning on the basement light with something: now the Terrifying Basement is lighted.

The N-gate is a not-gate. It is everywhere.

The R-gate is a relay. It is everywhere. The R-gate controls the N-gate. The N-gate controls the R-gate.

When play begins, try silently switching on the R-gate.

The A-gate is an and-gate. It is everywhere. The counter of the A-gate is 0. The blue switch and the R-gate control the A-gate.

The O-gate is an or-gate. It is everywhere. The counter of the O-gate is 1. The red switch and the A-gate control the O-gate.

The O-gate controls the basement light.

Understand "flip [something switched off]" as switching on. Understand "flip [something switched on]" as switching off. Understand "flip [something]" as switching on.
