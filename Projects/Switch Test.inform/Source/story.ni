The Terrifying Basement is a room.

The red switch is a switched on device in the Terrifying Basement. It is fixed in place.
The blue switch is a switched off device in the Terrifying Basement. It is fixed in place.

Instead of turning off the basement light with something: now the Terrifying Basement is dark.
Instead of turning on the basement light with something: now the Terrifying Basement is lighted.

The X-gate is a xor-gate in the Terrifying Basement. The counter of the X-gate is 1. The red switch and the blue switch control the X-gate.

The X-gate controls the basement light.
